NAME
       rt90 - coordinate conversion between RT90 and SWEREF99

SYNOPSIS
       rt90 [-N] [north east]
       rt90 [--from | --to] [-N] [north east]
       rt90 --test
       rt90 --version
       rt90 --help

DESCRIPTION
       rt90  is  a  small utility for safely converting between the coordinate
       systems  (or  whatever  the  proper   term   is)   RT90 2.5 gon V   and
       SWEREF 99 TM.  RT90  is  the  most popular coordinate system for use in
       Sweden; SWEREF 99 is the new standard we're switching to. Both assign a
       north and an east coordinate, expressed in meters, to every spot in the
       country (and some spots outside it, I bet).

       This  is really just a wrapper script; the operation relies entirely on
       the proj (also known as libproj, libproj0 or PROJ.4) set of tools,  and
       information on RT90/SWEREF 99 gleaned from a multitude of sources.
