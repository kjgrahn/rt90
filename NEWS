rt90 - coordinate conversion between RT90 and SWEREF99
Release history
------------------------------------------------------------

rt90 2.1 (2012-07-18):

- Copy the EPSG=3006 parameters from the libproj data files, so these
  don't have to be installed for rt90(1) to work.  Probably this
  increases performance too.

- User interface change. For converting standard input, you now have
  to specify if you want to convert from RT90 or to RT90. Both at the
  same time turned out to be too messy, and potentially dangerous.

rt90 2.0 (2012-07-14):

- Reimplemented in C++ (using libproj) rather than as a Python wrapper
  around the libproj command-line tools.  More fun, faster, and much more
  reliable.

rt90 1.0 (2012-06-26):

- First release.
